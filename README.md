# RMG

This program is an app that I wrote during my sophomore year of college. It was an attempt to use the [Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) standard to create music. This was written as a learning exercise, so the algorithm to generate music in not very complicated. Because of this, this program is really only useful for small musical ideas or inspiration, but not for complete songs. This program was written in Java using JavaFX and the Java Sound API.

## Getting Started

Since this program was written in Java, you can run it using the JAR file directly, if you have Java installed. If not, you can use an IDE like [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/), install the [JavaFX package](https://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html), and then compile the code.
